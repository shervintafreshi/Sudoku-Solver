# Sudoku-Solving Application Python

* A program that will take matrixs of numbers and will solve for the subsequent sudoku solution. 

## Future Patches:

* Utilize the multi-processing library 
* Use openCL for parallel determination of solutions
* Implement more efficient algorithms to solve sub-grids
